The data set is about the number of sharing articles on a website. There are 19 predictors in this data. Such as: Number of words in the title,Number of words in the content, Number of links, Number of links to other articles published by Mashable, Number of links to other articles published by Mashable, Number of images,Number of videos, different kinds of channels (Lifestyle,Entertainment,Business, Social Media, Tech, World...) and if the article is published on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc. The purpose of my analysis is to predict the number of sharing. I would use regression tree model and boosted tree model.
